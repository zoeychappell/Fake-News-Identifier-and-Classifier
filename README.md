# Fake-News-Identifier-and-Classifier
The objective of the project is to train models through supervised and unsupervised learning methods to determine which approach is the most effective. Supervised machine learning algorithms will use the real/fake labels provided to determine whether an untested news article is real or fake. Unsupervised machine learning will be utilized to classify the data into families that were not originally derived from the provided dataset. Examples of families might include political bias, satire, ideological framing, or sensationalism. This project can be used to provide insight into the most common types of disinformation that are spread and will apply to any text-based media. 

# Dataset used: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nitishjolly/news-detection-fake-or-real-dataset/data

This dataset consists of news items labeled as either “fake” or “real,” and it can be used to identify false or misleading news (Jolly, N). Out of 9865 total values,  51% of the values are labeled “fake,”  and the other 49% are labeled “real” (Jolly, N). The dataset contains raw, noisy text, such as words ending in a colon, that require preprocessing before machine learning algorithms are applied. 

This dataset was created by “Kaggle Expert” Nitish Jolly who is a student at Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology.
